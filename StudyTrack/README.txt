A task manager that allows you to track your courses and assignments. With this management, youâ€™re able to use the app's timer system to focus on an assignment you want and take a break when needed.

To clone and run the application:
We used build path 1.8 and the same version of scenebuilder / FX as was used in class in order to maximiza compatibility on presentation day. 

As far as we know, the app is completely functional and we have done our best to get rid of all bugs in the final version of the application. 

Bug Report:        
* Timer starts going down quickly after multiple clicks. 

Versions needed: Java 1.8
